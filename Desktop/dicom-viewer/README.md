🧠 DICOM Viewer with Tumor Classification & Grad-CAM

A Python-based DICOM viewer that integrates medical image visualization with
deep learning–based brain tumor classification and Grad-CAM explainability.

This project combines a PyQt-based medical image viewer with a pre-trained
TensorFlow model to classify brain tumors and visualize model attention regions.
